Sqitch RPM Spec Files
=====================

RPM Spec files to build packages on CentOS 6 that are required by Sqitch but
not provided by CentOS core ore EPEL.

There might be a few more; I'm not sure of the provenience of these RPMS:

* Term-ANSIColor
* perl-Encode-Locale
* perl-Hash-Merge
* perl-Path-Class
* perl-String-ShellQuote
* perl-namespace-autoclean
